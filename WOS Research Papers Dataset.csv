Moreover, there are a large number of features that have impact on the energy consumption of the residential load. Recently, deep learning algorithms are widely used for short-term load forecasting (STLF) of residential load. Although deep learning algorithms are capable of achieving promising results due to their ability in feature extraction, machine learning algorithms are also prone to obtain satisfactory results with lower complexity and easier implementation. Identifying the most dominant features which have the highest impact on residential load is a pragmatic measure to boost the accuracy of STLF. But deep learning algorithms use feature extraction, which leads to the loss of data interpretability due to transforming the data. This paper proposes to improve the accuracy of the individual residential STLF using an enhanced machine learning-based approach via a feature-engineering framework. To this end, various datasets and features such as historical load and climate features are collected. Afterward, correlation analysis and outlier detection via the k nearest neighbor algorithm are deployed to implement outlier detection. In the next stage, feature selection algorithms are used to identify the foremost dominant features. Additionally, this paper conducts a comparative study between the proposed approach and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Eventually, the isolation forest algorithm is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach by identifying anomalous samples and comparing the results of the proposed approach with those of deep learning algorithms.",2022-09,,,210,,,,"Place: PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA Type: Article",Deep learning; Feature selection; Machine learning; Outlier detection; Residential load forecasting,

Traditional methods tend to avoid such uncertainty by load aggregation (to offset uncertainties), customer classification (to cluster uncertainties) and spectral analysis (to filter out uncertainties). This paper, for the first time, aims to directly learn the uncertainty by applying a new breed of machine learning algorithms deep learning. However, simply adding layers in neural networks will cap the forecasting performance due to the occurrence of over-fitting. A novel pooling-based deep recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper which batches a group of customers' load profiles into a pool of inputs. Essentially the model could address the over-fitting issue by increasing data diversity and volume. This paper reports the first attempts to develop a bespoke deep learning application for household load forecasting and achieved preliminary success. The developed method is implemented on Tensorflow deep learning platform and tested on 920 smart metered customers from Ireland.

Existing short-term electric load forecasting methods are mainly used to obtain regional power load for system-level power dispatch. Due to the high volatility, strong randomness, and weak regularity of the residential load of a single household, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the traditional methods forecasting results would be too big to be used for home energy management. With the increase in the total number of households, the aggregated load becomes more and more stable, and the cyclical pattern of the aggregated load becomes more and more distinct. In the meantime, the maximum daily load does not increase linearly with the increase in households in a small area. Therefore, in our proposed short-term residential load forecasting method, an optimal number of households would be selected adaptively, and the total aggregated residential load of the selected households is used for load prediction. In addition, ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS) algorithm are also selected to cluster households with similar power consumption patterns adaptively. It can be used to enhance the periodic regularity of the aggregated load in alternative. The aggregated residential load and encoded external factors are then used to predict the load in the next half an hour.

Short-term electric load forecasting for individual residential customers plays a progressively crucial role in the operation and planning of future grids. Compared to the aggregated electrical load at the community level, the prediction of individual household electric loads is legitimately challenging because of the high uncertainty and volatility involved. Results from previous studies show that prediction using machine learning and deep learning models is far from accurate, and there is still room for improvement. We herein propose a deep learning framework based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model uses CNN layers for feature extraction from the input data with LSTM layers for sequence learning. The performance of our developed framework is comprehensively compared to state-of-the-art systems currently in use for short-term individual household electric load forecasting. The proposed model achieved significantly better results compared to other competing techniques. We evaluated our proposed model with the recently explored LSTM-based deep learning model on a publicly available electrical load data of individual household customers from the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project. We obtained an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 40.38% for individual household electric load forecasts in comparison with the LSTM-based model that obtained an average MAPE of 44.06%. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed model on different time horizons (up to 3 h ahead).

To improve the accuracy of residential load forecasting, this paper proposes a combined deep learning load fore-casting model considering multi-time scale electricity consumption behavior of single household resident user to achieve high-accuracy and stable load forecasting. Aiming at the electricity consumption behavior, the multi -time scale similarity analysis is carried out. For the time scale of one year, Normalized Dynamic Time Warp-ing (N-DTW) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) are used to analyze the significance of single user's long-term electricity consumption behavior. For the time scale of 7 days, behavior similarity is used to analyze the consistency of single user's short-term electricity consumption behavior.

Most of these DSM programs are designed to work at household and hour level. The optimization problems in these DSM programs are guided by the forecasted load. An error in the hour ahead load forecasting results in a suboptimal solution entailing economic cost to both the utility and the customers. Predicting loads at a fine granularity (e.g., households) is challenging due to a large number of (known or unknown) factors affecting power consumption. At larger scales (e.g., clusters of consumers), since the inherent stochasticity and fluctuations are averaged out, the problem becomes substantially easier. Many techniques have been proposed to predict loads of clusters of consumers in various localities with great accuracy. Also, these techniques generally utilize sociological and weather information and work better on data from a particular locality. In this paper, a new technique called Past Vector Similarity (PVS) has been proposed to predict electricity load one hour ahead at the level of an individual household. The proposed strategy is based on load information only and does not require calendar, weather or any other attributes. In fact, the idea is to extract the exact load patterns of individual households corresponding to their routine and socio-economic values. Consequently, the technique makes use of the recent past vector and generate similar patterns for the prediction of future load profiles. Furthermore, the ensemble of these similar loads is an efficient prediction of electricity. PVS has just two parameters due to which it can be applied to the smaller dataset without overfitting issue. Moreover, due to the parallel nature of PVS, it can be scaled for a large number of customers without computation burden. The proposed PVS has been assessed empirically for two distinct datasets from Australia and Sweden.

In these areas, electricity demand is influenced by different phenomena accounting for climate conditions and comfort preferences. The uncertain nature of these circumstances results in power profiles with diverse patterns. Under this condition, overall load prediction is suggested by utilizing Cluster-based Aggregate Forecasting (CBAF). Accordingly, this paper proposes a unified approach to such a practice. The proposed scheme employs an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm to develop a time-series clustering scheme that performs the classification task through the k-medoids-based clustering incorporating the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. Subsequently, a consensus is achieved among the resultant clusters where the Jaccard similarity index adjudges the similarity measurement. The Additive Gaussian Process (AGP), a powerful non-parametric forecasting technique, is exploited to predict aggregated load at each cluster level. With low complexity and high scalability, AGP is particularly utilized to provide effective forecasting. Numerical simulations on synthetic as well as real datasets have been carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Additionally, two comparative studies are carried out with forecasts without clustering and with the benchmark non-parametric models employing a cluster-based technique. The proposed method demonstrates significant improvement in forecasting accuracy for both datasets by reducing the error metrics and achieving 7% improvement in the coefficient of determination (??????2) value as compared to the aggregated load forecast achieved without clustering.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for day-ahead single-household electricity consumption forecasting by learning the peak consumption patterns of users. Instead of attempting to obtain the electricity consumption curve for the future 24 hours, the prediction of electricity consumption is achieved by combining the predicted base consumption, the predicted peak consumption occurrence time and the predicted amount of peak consumption within each time interval.

Furthermore, the representation of the spatial graph structure is frequently inadequate and constrained, along with the complexities inherent in Spatial-Temporal data, impeding the effective learning among different households. To alleviate those shortcomings, this article proposes a novel framework: Spatial-Temporal fusion adaptive gated graph convolution networks (STFAG-GCNs), tailored for residential short-term load forecasting (STLF).

Three regression-based and seven deep learning algorithms with different model configurations were evaluated in terms of their overall and peak load prediction accuracy, and training burdens, across spatial aggregation levels ranging from the transformer, feeder, substation, to neighborhood. We found, first, the load forecasting accuracy is constrained by a predictability boundary, influenced by the forecasting horizon and spatial aggregation level.

However, existing load forecasting methodologies are often inefficient when a high load demand persists for a few hours in a day. Peak load consumption is explicitly depicted as a tail in the probability distribution function (PDF) of the load series. Due to the diverse and uncertain nature of peak load demands, DL methodologies have difficulty maintaining consistent forecasting results, particularly when the PDF of the load series has a longer tail. This paper proposes a multihousehold load forecasting strategy based on the collective moment measure (CMM) (which is obtained from the PDF of the load series), data augmentation, and a CNN. Each load series was compared and ordered through CMM indexing, which helped maintain a minimum or constant shifting variance in the dataset inputted to the CNN. Data augmentation was used to enlarge the input dataset and solve the existing data requirement issues of the CNN.

The variation of patterns captured from non-AC part is further input as internal heat gain to a physics-based model. The model uses a 2R-1C thermal network and an AC regression model. By utilizing this hybrid approach, we get AC load prediction and non-AC energy forecast simultaneously. Total energy consumption is further produced by summing up the two sub meters forecast for hybrid model. The results from new modeling are compared with those from pure data-driven techniques. The final result showing improvements of coefficient of variance between the best data-driven model and hybrid model are 6-10% and 2-15% for hour ahead and 24-h ahead, respectively.

Large scale smart meter deployments have resulted in ability to collect massive energy data and have created opportunities in sensor-based forecasting. Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated great successes in sensor -based load forecasting; however, when prediction is needed on a smart meter level, typically a single model is trained for each smart meter. With a large number of meters, this becomes computationally expensive or even infeasible. On the other hand, with conventional ML, training a single model for several smart meters requires participants to share their data with the central server. Consequently, this paper proposes federated learning for load forecasting with smart meter data: this strategy enables training a single model with all participating smart meters without the need to share local data. Two alternative federated learning strategies are examined: FedSGD, which performs one step of gradient descent on client before merging updates on the server, and FedAVG, which carries out several steps before the merging. Specifically, residential consumers are diverse what makes training a single model challenging as load profiles vary across consumers.

Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymakers and building owners to understand consumer's demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Alongside its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively.

With continuously growing energy consumption, the importance of energy management including load forecasting is increasing in order to remedy the energy effect on the environment. Numerous machine learning techniques have been proposed for sensor-based load forecasting but most are offline approaches: the model is trained once and then used to infer future consumption. However, these approaches are not able to adapt to concept drift: for example, their accuracy will degrade when the building use changes or new equipment is installed. Thus, an approach capable of learning from new data as they arrive is needed. This paper proposes adaptive online ensemble learning with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and ARIMA for load forecasting under concept drift. The RNN part of the ensembles consists of Online Adaptive RNN as its underlying RNN learner has the ability to model temporal dependencies present in load data while its online nature enables continuous learning from arriving data. The adaptation to the concept drift is improved by adding Rolling ARIMA to the ensemble.

However, it becomes challenging due to the non-linear and seasonally fluctuating energy usage of domestic users. Existing statistical and machine learning-based forecasting models struggle to produce accurate forecasts due to dynamic and stochastic user behaviors for energy usage. On the other hand, pairwise ensemble methods can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in short-term load forecasting, but are not scalable and face generalization issues that often lead to overfitting and complexity in managing multivariate data. To address these limitations, we propose to integrate LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost models to systematically address the limitations of existing ensemble-based forecasting models. This integration aims to leverage the strengths of each ensemble method, where LightGBM handles generalization across multiple sites, XGBoost avoids overfitting the model, and CatBoost effectively manages categorical features. We implement our proposed model using a real-world, publicly available dataset for 13 residential locations in North America and Europe. The proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms with the lowest root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) values of 0.1898, while the coefficient of determination (R2) calculated from the data is 0.9745.

The ability of traditional prediction methods is limited due to a large amount of fine-grained data with high uncertainty, and many researchers have applied deep learning to SLTF thereby. However, perspectives to study and develop deep neural network forecasters are yet to be freed from time domain. Frequency domain analysis provides a sufficient path to assess the periodic characteristics of load. By insights from the spectrum of load data, significant periodic fluctuation characteristics of load are revealed. Based on this, a dual time granularity inputs structured RNNs ensemble STLF model is proposed, which unites two independent input-featured RNNs to learn more time-frequency characteristics implied in fine-grained load. One RNN is mainly responsible for mining time-domain features of load, the other focuses on learning frequency-domain features.

Different from the traditional deep learning for point forecasting, the SGLQRDNN model realizes the probability density forecasting of the load. SGLQRDNN modelling integrates two strategies to alleviate the dilemma of quantile crossing and structural complexity. The SGLQRDNN model mitigates the deficiency of quantile crossing by a joint estimation of non-crossing constraints. It also realizes the shrinkage of the network and the selection of critical features with the sparse-group Lasso algorithm. The proposed model is trained and tested using the residential daily electricity consumption data. The experimental results show that SGLQRDNN has advantages in interpretability, sparsity, and performance criteria. Specifically, the monotonicity of its internal quantiles is 4.18%-9.96% higher than that of the unconstrained model. Compared with three sparse regularization networks, SGLQRDNN can shrink 88.47% of the connection weights and 19.32% of neurons. Meanwhile, its performance improvement ranges from 5.76% to 18.28%. Additionally, its training speed is 2.73-7.01 times faster than the model trained on individual quantiles.

It has become more and more difficult for traditional methods to meet the STLF demand of smart grid. Meanwhile, global time series forecasting method emerges gradually in many fields, which can make predictions for many agents only by one model with much lower complexity. However, there is few researches on the multi-agent global STLF. This study proposes a global deep-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) STLF model based on a pretraining method.

This paper presents a scalable and hybrid approach for forecasting the power load based on Vector Auto Regression (VAR) and hybrid deep learning techniques like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN and LSTM models are well known for handling time series data. The VAR model separates the linear pattern in time series data, and CNN-LSTM is utilized to model non-linear patterns in data.
